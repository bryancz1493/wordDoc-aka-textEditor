# Progressive Web Application (PWA) Challenge: Text Editor

My task is to build a text editor displaying in browser mode. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA requirement. It will feature a number of data to avoid bugging out. The app can work on offline mode too.

# User Story

* AS a Bootcamp developer
* I WANT to create a text editor that works in browser and offline mode
* SO THAT I can use it in a daily basic

# Acceptance Criteria

* WHEN I open the app in editor
* THEN I should see a client folder
* WHEN I run 'npm run'
* THEN the app should start up as backend and serve the client
* WHEN I run text editor app from terminal
* THEN I find that my JS files have been bundled using webpack
* WHEN I run webpack plugins
* THEN HTML files, service worker, manifest files are generated
* WHEN I open text editor
* THEN a database storage has been created
* WHEN I input some content and close the DOM window
